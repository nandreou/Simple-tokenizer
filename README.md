  This is a tokenizer, it takes an input string for the file from cli and according to the tokens that have been "hardcoded" in this example of the program, it prints info for the frequency of appearence in the text, the lines in which the token appears and the token number. 
  In this example is just some simple programing language tokens but with some fantasy and improvisation with the tokens, this tool cam be a great pattern recognition tool for texts and much more other things.

Use tfile.txt to test it.
